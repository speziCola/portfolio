          <h3 className="project__title">One sentence summary</h3>
          <p className="project__text">
            The 8-Grid Paper is based on the <a var="link" href="https://builttoadapt.io/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632">8-Point Grid System</a>.
            It works like a scale model helping to meet the end result more precisely.
          </p>
          <span className="project__spacer"></span>

          <h3 className="project__title">Motivation</h3>
          <p className="project__text">
            Sketching is nothing new. The 8-Grid Paper however works like a scale model.
            It will help to see every component in perspective. Therefore the sketches are becoming more consistent.
            <br /><br />
            <span className="project__marker">Who will benefit?</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span className="project__marker">Designers:</span> Less decisions and concessions when designing a high fidelity prototype afterwards.
                They can easy keep track of an 8 Pixel increment while sketching.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="project__marker">The Team:</span> An easy system of communication between Designers, Product Owners and Developers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="project__marker">The Project:</span> Especially if the interface is bounded to a certain screen resolution.
              </li>

          <h3 className="project__title">Main features</h3>
          <p className="project__text">
            Every child square on the sketch sheet represents 8px and every parent square 64px. <br />
            For example: iPhone 5s (320px) consist of 40 child squares or 5 parent squares.

          <p className="project__text">
            <span className="project__marker">Peter, 27 years old. - UI Designer</span> <br />
            While sketching he always wanted to know how much space he really has.
            Can he make this Icon that big? Does he have enough space left between his elements?
            <br /><br />
            <span className="project__marker">Tom, 26 years old. - UX Designer</span> <br />
            He wants to know if the user sees everything without scrolling?
          </p>
          <span className="project__spacer"></span>

          <h3 className="project__title">Stories</h3>
          <p className="project__text">
            Using the 8-Grid Paper Peter is able to see right away if an element still
            has enough space and if he can add another icon to his component. This saves him time and
            leads to less mistakes.
            <br /><br />
            Due to the real proportion Tom knowâ€™s on which position the interaction will happen
            and if the user has to scroll to make an action.
